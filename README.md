# Why does this for exist
I want to compare perfomance of my own implementation to publicly availably ones

# AIToolbox
A toolbox of AI modules written in Swift:  Graphs/Trees, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, PCA, KMeans, Genetic Algorithms, MDP, Mixture of Gaussians, Logistic Regression

This framework uses the Accelerate library to speed up computations, except the Linux package versions.
Written for Swift 3.1.  Earlier versions are Swift 2.2 compatible

SVM ported from the public domain LIBSVM repository
See https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ for more information

The Metal Neural Network uses the Metal framework for a Neural Network using the GPU.  While it works in preliminary testing, more work could be done with this class

Use the XCTest files for examples on how to use the classes

Playgrounds for Linear Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks are available.  Now available in both macOS and iOS versions.

###New - Convolution Program
For the Deep Network classes, please look at the [Convolution](https://github.com/KevinCoble/Convolution) project that uses the AIToolbox library to do image recognition.

### New Swift Package - Mac and Linux compatible!
The package is a sub-set of the full framework.  Classes that require GCD or LAPACK have not been ported.  I am investigating LAPACK on Linux alternatives, and may someday figure out how to get libdispatch to compile on Ubuntu...

##  Manual

I have started a [manual](Manual/AIToolbox.md) for the framework.  It is a work-in-progress, but adds some useful explanation to pieces of the framework.  All protocols, structures, and enumerations are well defined.  Class descriptions are there, but not class variables and methods.
